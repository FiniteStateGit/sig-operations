## SIG Updates

Discord has grown considerably and more scaling is required.

Initial stats tracking added.

## Meeting Agenda

 - Proper permisisons and roles for Discord: There is a need to define multiple levels of moderation that have varying levels of permissions
 - There is a need to grow moderators to scale - suggestions were to announce and put names up for vote along with participation in discord (posts / activity) with a minumum amount of engagement.
 - Request to create self assigned SIG roles so a group can be notified.
 - Request to create industry discipline self assigned roles.
 - Need for the right hand column grouping to be cleaned up for better location and identification of community leaders
 - Request for SSO integration to groups.io, discord, and other used sites. Low priority, so deferred to another time when the need merits action.
 - Calendar permissions need to be adjusted to allow for users to get emails when events occur.
